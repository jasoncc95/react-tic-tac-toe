In React, a component is a piece of reusable code that represents a part of a user interface. Components are used to render, manage, and update the UI elements in your application.

A JSX element is a combination of JavaScript code and HTML tags that describes what you’d like to display. 

React provides a special function called useState that you can call from your component to let it “remember” things.

When you call a set function in a component, React automatically updates the child components inside too.

React DevTools let you check the props and the state of your React components.
